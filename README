# Testing

The Main class runs the checker on your implementation. Add the entry point to your implementation in it.

Run Main to test your implementation from the IDE or from command line.

# About the code
    The project starts with processing the input and storing the data into specific class objects.
    Therefore, we have created the following packages and classes for a better suggestive and logic representation of all children.

* tests - contains the provided tests in JSON format
* src
   * checker - the checker's sources including the checkstyle necessary files, not to be modified
   * fileio - classes for parsing the input files, the logic that parses them
   * common, utils
        * contain utility classes with constants and static methods

    * database : - here we have all classes that store arrays of santa's children (children/presents/changes)
                   which will be processed in the given tasks
                 - all constructors populate the object arrays with input data processed in the "fileio" package classes
                 - all database classes are in !a aggregation relationship! with the specific santa entity
        - AnnualData =     - constructs and stores all information about children and presents
                           - also can preform different actions(methods) of setting data, sorting and searching in the stored
                             arrays. These arrays are updated based on the new children/presents lists received
                           - has method that is called for updating children's age
                           - all methods are logically related with all children and all presents
        - AnnualChangeData = - constructs and stores all information about changes in an array of newChildren, newGifts,
                               children updates. It also stores santa's new budget and can preform search actions on given arrays
        - ChildrenUpdatesData =  - constructs and stores all information about each child update
                                 - also can perform update action for the given child by changing certain characteristics of it
                                   like gift preferences and nice score

    * children : - here we have classes of all category age children( Teen, Baby, Kid) were we store the characteristics
                    and methods of those children
                 - all those classes are created based on 3 design patterns
                        -> factory : we want to isolate the object that needs an instance of a certain type, from its actual creation.
                                    In addition, the class that will use the instance does not even need to specify exactly the subclass
                                    of the object to be created, so it does not need to know all the implementations of that type, but only
                                    what characteristics the created object must have.
                        -> strategy : we want a type of algorithm (strategy) with several possible implementations and we want
                                      to choose dynamically which algorithm we use, without making the system too tightly coupled.
                                      Since we need 3 implementation for setting the average score, the strategy pattern is the most suited.
                                    : because the factory and strategy pattern overlapped and because of logical purposes
                                      => We will omit the strategy word from the classes name, but we keep in mind that kid, baby, teen are
                                      the classes that implement the setAverage strategy
                        -> singleton :  we need our factory to be used from several components of the application. To save memory, it is enough
                                        to have a single instance of the factory and use it. As a solution we make the factory class a singleton
        - Child = - abstract class that can't be instantiated since it's used to force all classes that extends
                    her to implement strategies for the abstract method specified
                  - the class contains relevant information/characteristics about each child
                  - the class also contains methods that set, reset, get and search in different ways some characteristics
          Baby = - class that extends Child and promises to implement the abstract method setAverageScore
                 - it implements the strategy required : average score = 10;
          Kid =  - class that extends Child and promises to implement the abstract method setAverageScore
                 - it implements the strategy required : average score = arithmetic average of all nice scores;
          Teen = - class that extends Child and promises to implement the abstract method setAverageScore
                 - it implements the strategy required : average score = weighted average of all nice scores;
          ChildFactory = - implements the factory design pattern through createFactory method that based on a child
                           age, constructs the respective object of category age which is also a strategy for the setAverageScore
                           method.
                         - the creteFactory is also overloaded, since there are 2 options of received child data
                         - the class is also a singleton

    * santa :  - here we have classes related to santa : santaJob and present
        - Present :  - the class contains relevant information/characteristics about each child
                     - the class also implements Comparable interface through compraTo method to facilitate
                       future sorting operations
        - SantaJob : - class that stores all information about santa's job through arrays and objects specified
                       in the database package
                     - implements annualJob method that makes all updates, sets all arrays and distributes the
                        presents to all children
                     - in aggregation relationship with classes from database package
     THE FLOW OF THE PROGRAMME:
        The data input is processed and stored in databases(arrays) of certain entities objects.
        AnnualJob method, sets all entities fields and for each annual change input, reset fields such as children
        presents, budget. It makes all necessary updates and distributes the presents to all children based on the
        required criteria and procedure.
